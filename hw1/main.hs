-- reduce all valid lambda expressions in the file and output results.
-- runProgram :: String -> (Lexp -> Lexp) -> IO ()

-- This is the identity function for the Lexp datatype, which is
-- used to illustrate pattern matching with the datatype. "_" was
-- used since I did not need to use bound variable. For your code,
-- however, you can replace "_" with an actual variable name so you
-- can use the bound variable. The "@" allows you to retain a variable
-- that represents the entire structure, while pattern matching on
-- components of the structure.
